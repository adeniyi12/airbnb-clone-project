# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript (React) for the frontend, Git and Github for version control and figma for design.
